<h1>ABOUT SALONFIX</h1>
<h2>WHO ARE WE — AND WHY DO WE RUN SALONS LIKE THEY’RE OUR OWN?</h2>
<p>SALONFIX isn’t an app. It isn’t a casual consultant. SALONFIX is your in-house business partner — stepping in to run the backend of your salon every single day so you don’t have to.</p>
<p>“I’m JAWHAR RAJ RAJKUMAR, and I created SALONFIX after more than a decade inside salons — leading teams, fixing systems, and turning chaos into profit. I saw one truth again and again: owners were exhausted, but the salon still wasn’t running right. SALONFIX changes that by running your salon like it’s our own — so you don’t have to.”</p>

<li>Your Time, Freed Up – You finally step back — and the salon still runs perfectly.</li>
</ul>
