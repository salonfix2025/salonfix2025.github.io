    <!-- ABOUT THE FOUNDER -->
    <section data-aos="fade-up">
        <h2>MEET THE FOUNDER – JAWHAR RAJ RAJKUMAR</h2>
        <p>“I’ve spent over a decade inside salons — running teams, fixing systems, and turning chaos into profit. I created SALONFIX for one reason: so salon owners don’t have to focus on anything except walking into their salon and seeing it run perfectly. Every piece of data we send, every system we install, and every cost we control is built around one promise: SALONFIX runs your salon like it’s our own — so you never have to.”</p>

    <!-- WHAT IS SALONFIX -->
    <section data-aos="fade-up">
        <h2>WHAT EXACTLY IS SALONFIX?</h2>
        <p>We step into your salon like we own it — tracking every number, fixing every leak, and building every system you wish you had time for.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Daily Data & Weekly Data:</strong> You see your sales, profits, and gaps clearly.</li>
            <li><strong>Team Accountability:</strong> Training, incentives, and checklists in place.</li>
            <li><strong>Stock & Cost Control:</strong> No more product wastage or “missing” items.</li>

            <li>Where is all the money going?</li>
            <li>Why does stock keep running out or expiring?</li>
            <li>Am I overpaying vendors without realizing it?</li>
            <li>Why does the salon run only when I’m there?</li>
            <li>Why aren’t clients coming back more often?</li>
            <li>Why do small issues stay unfixed?</li>
            <li>Why don’t I have a clear view of my salon?</li>
        </ul>

    <!-- WHAT WE DO -->
