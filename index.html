    <h2>MEET THE FOUNDER – JAWHAR RAJ RAJKUMAR</h2>
    <p>“I’ve spent over a decade inside salons — running teams, fixing systems, and turning chaos into profit. I created SALONFIX for one reason: so salon owners don’t have to focus on anything except walking into their salon and seeing it run perfectly. Every piece of data we send, every system we install, and every cost we control is built around one promise: SALONFIX runs your salon like it’s our own — so you never have to.”</p>

    <h2>WHAT EXACTLY IS SALONFIX?</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Daily Data & Weekly Data – You see your sales, profits, and gaps clearly.</li>

    <h2>DO YOU EVER WONDER WHY YOUR SALON ISN’T RUNNING AS SMOOTHLY AS IT SHOULD?</h2>
    <h3>AREN’T THESE THE QUESTIONS THAT KEEP YOU UP AT NIGHT?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Where is all the money going?</li>
      <li>Why does stock keep running out or expiring?</li>
      <li>Am I overpaying vendors without realizing it?</li>
      <li>Why does the salon run only when I’m there?</li>
      <li>Why aren’t clients coming back more often?</li>
      <li>Why do small issues stay unfixed?</li>
      <li>Why don’t I have a clear view of my salon?</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>IF THESE QUESTIONS SOUND FAMILIAR, WHY HAVEN’T YOU CALLED SALONFIX YET?</strong></p>

    <h2>WHAT KIND OF RESULTS CAN SALONFIX REALLY DELIVER?</h2>
    <h3>WHAT HAPPENS WHEN SYSTEMS REPLACE GUESSWORK?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>30% LESS PRODUCT WASTAGE – When stock is tracked daily, nothing “slips away.”</li>
      <li>10–20% VENDOR SAVINGS – Old supplier rates get renegotiated, and silent costs drop.</li>
      <li>ACCOUNTABLE, MOTIVATED TEAMS – Staff know what’s expected, and deliver without micromanaging.</li>
      <li>REBOOKING RATES RISE – More clients return, more revenue stays consistent.</li>
      <li>CLEAR, GROWING PROFITS – Owners finally see the data match the effort.</li>

    <h3>WHEN WILL YOUR SALON FINALLY RUN THE WAY YOU WANT IT TO?</h3>
    <p>Your salon doesn’t need another piece of software. It doesn’t need more casual “tips” or quick fixes. It needs a dedicated partner to take over the operational weight — so you can step back, see the bigger picture, and relax knowing everything is handled.</p>
