  <!-- ABOUT ME -->
  <section data-aos="fade-up">
    <h2>MEET THE FOUNDER – JAWHAR RAJ RAJKUMAR</h2>
    <p>“I’ve spent over a decade inside salons — running teams, fixing systems, and turning chaos into profit. I created SALONFIX for one reason: so salon owners don’t have to focus on anything except walking into their salon and seeing it run perfectly. Every piece of data we send, every system we install, and every cost we control is built around one promise: SALONFIX runs your salon like it’s our own — so you never have to.”</p>

  <!-- WHAT IS SALONFIX -->
  <section data-aos="fade-up">
    <h2>WHAT EXACTLY IS SALONFIX?</h2>
    <h3>IS IT AN APP, A CONSULTANT — OR SOMETHING MORE?</h3>
    <p>We step into your salon like we own it — tracking every number, fixing every leak, and building every system you wish you had time for.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Daily Data & Weekly Data</strong> – You see your sales, profits, and gaps clearly.</li>
      <li><strong>Team Accountability</strong> – Training, incentives, and checklists in place.</li>
      <li><strong>Stock & Cost Control</strong> – No more product wastage or “missing” items.</li>
      <li><strong>Growth Strategy</strong> – Pricing, marketing, and expansion mapped for you.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>WHO ELSE WOULD TAKE OVER YOUR SALON BACKEND LIKE THIS?</em></p>
  </section>

  <!-- PAIN POINTS -->
  <section data-aos="fade-up">
    <h2>DO YOU EVER WONDER WHY YOUR SALON ISN’T RUNNING AS SMOOTHLY AS IT SHOULD?</h2>
    <h3>AREN’T THESE THE QUESTIONS THAT KEEP YOU UP AT NIGHT?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Where is all the money going?</li>
      <li>Why does stock keep running out or expiring?</li>
      <li>Am I overpaying vendors without realizing it?</li>
      <li>Why does the salon run only when I’m there?</li>
      <li>Why aren’t clients coming back more often?</li>
      <li>Why do small issues stay unfixed?</li>
      <li>Why don’t I have a clear view of my salon?</li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>IF THESE QUESTIONS SOUND FAMILIAR, WHY HAVEN’T YOU CALLED SALONFIX YET?</em></p>

  <!-- WHAT WE DO -->
  <section data-aos="fade-up">
    <h2>WHAT IF EVERY PROBLEM IN YOUR SALON HAD A SYSTEM TO FIX IT?</h2>
    <h3>AND WHAT IF SOMEONE ELSE BUILT THOSE SYSTEMS FOR YOU — AND RAN THEM EVERY DAY?</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>NUMBERS & DATA</strong> – Daily sales, profit, and expense data tracked. Weekly and monthly data that reveals the real picture — so you stop guessing.</li>
      <li><strong>TEAM ACCOUNTABILITY</strong> – Structured training and incentive plans. Clear systems that guide your team, without micromanaging.</li>
      <li><strong>STOCK & VENDOR CONTROL</strong> – Product usage tracked — nothing “slips through the cracks.” Vendor pricing reviewed and renegotiated to protect margins.</li>
      <li><strong>OWNER FREEDOM & GROWTH</strong> – Operations run smoothly even when you’re not there. Pricing, marketing, and expansion strategies mapped and ready.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><em>WHO ELSE WOULD BUILD THESE SYSTEMS — IF NOT SALONFIX?</em></p>

  <!-- PROOF -->
  <section data-aos="fade-up">
    <h2>WHAT KIND OF RESULTS CAN SALONFIX REALLY DELIVER?</h2>
    <h3>WHAT HAPPENS WHEN SYSTEMS REPLACE GUESSWORK?</h3>
    <p>Every salon we work with sees measurable, trackable change. The numbers speak for themselves:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>30% LESS PRODUCT WASTAGE</strong> – When stock is tracked daily, nothing “slips away.”</li>
      <li><strong>10–20% VENDOR SAVINGS</strong> – Old supplier rates get renegotiated, and silent costs drop.</li>
      <li><strong>ACCOUNTABLE, MOTIVATED TEAMS</strong> – Staff know what’s expected, and deliver without micromanaging.</li>
      <li><strong>REBOOKING RATES RISE</strong> – More clients return, more revenue stays consistent.</li>
      <li><strong>CLEAR, GROWING PROFITS</strong> – Owners finally see the data match the effort.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>ISN’T THIS THE KIND OF GROWTH YOU’VE BEEN WAITING FOR?</em></p>

    <h2>WHEN WILL YOUR SALON FINALLY RUN THE WAY YOU WANT IT TO?</h2>
    <h3>AND WHO BETTER TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN — THAN SALONFIX?</h3>
    <p>Your salon doesn’t need another piece of software. It doesn’t need more casual “tips” or quick fixes. It needs a dedicated partner to take over the operational weight — so you can step back, see the bigger picture, and relax knowing everything is handled. SALONFIX brings structure, data, and control to every corner of your business — from daily sales to vendor costs — so you finally run your salon with clarity and confidence.</p>
