<h1>HOW WE WORK</h1>
<h2>WHAT HAPPENS WHEN SALONFIX STEPS INTO YOUR SALON?</h2>
<p>Most consultants give advice. Most apps give dashboards. SALONFIX takes over. We don’t tell you what to do — we build the systems and run them every day.</p>
<ol>
<li>Data Comes First – We track every sale, cost, and leak — daily. Within a week, you see your salon in a way you never have before.</li>
<li>Silent Leaks Get Fixed – Stock wastage, vendor overcharges, missed rebookings — we plug every hole.</li>
<li>Systems Take Over – From opening checklists to team incentives — your salon starts running on systems, not stress.</li>
<li>Owner Steps Back – You don’t need to “be there” for the salon to run right. SALONFIX runs it for you.</li>
</ol>
